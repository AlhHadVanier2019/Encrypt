Hi, my name is Hadi and I am a grade 11 student in the TDSB. I have used Turing, GameMaker Studio, and now Python to code projects. I am stil very inexperienced in coding and am hoping to get better by taking on a big project such as this one. After highschool, I am planning to study either software engineering or computer science at Ryerson or UofT. I haven't chosen which of the 2 courses I would like to pursue, and am keeping my options open. Currently, I am very interested in game development and I hope my programming skills will improve after doing a project such as this one.
